Minecraft 2D Game
=================

Welcome to Minecraft 2D, a simplified 2D version of the popular Minecraft game. In this game, you'll be able to mine and interact with the environment using different tools. The logic provided here handles the functionality related to tools in the game.

Tools Functionality
-------------------

### Tool Selection

The game allows you to select different tools (axe, shovel, pickaxe) to interact with the cells in the game world. Each tool has its own functionality.

#### Axe

*   Used for handling tool selection with the axe.
*   Clicking on the axe tool will prompt a question to the user ("What is the capital of France?").
*   If the user answers correctly ("Paris"), the selected tool will be updated, and the game will be ready for further interactions.

javascriptCopy code

`// Example usage for axe tool elementsToolAxe.forEach(function (element) {   element.addEventListener("click", function () {     handleToolSelection(9); // 9 is the identifier for the axe tool   }); });`

#### Shovel

*   Used for handling tool selection with the shovel.
*   Similar to the axe tool, it asks a question and proceeds if the answer is correct.

javascriptCopy code

`// Example usage for shovel tool elementsToolShovel.forEach(function (element) {   element.addEventListener("click", function () {     handleToolSelection(8); // 8 is the identifier for the shovel tool   }); });`

#### Pickaxe

*   Used for handling tool selection with the pickaxe.
*   As with the other tools, it asks a question and proceeds if the answer is correct.

javascriptCopy code

`// Example usage for pickaxe tool elementsToolPickaxe.forEach(function (element) {   element.addEventListener("click", function () {     handleToolSelection(4); // 4 is the identifier for the pickaxe tool   }); });`

### Handling Tool Selection

The `handleToolSelection` function is responsible for updating the selected tool and preparing the game for further interactions.

*   The function checks the user's answer to the question.
*   If the answer is correct, it sets the background image for the selected tool and updates the game state accordingly.

### Cell Interaction

The game allows you to interact with cells using the selected tool. The `handleCellClick` function handles the logic when a cell is clicked.

*   It checks if the clicked cell has the same background image as the selected tool.
*   If it matches, the cell's background image is updated, simulating the action of using the tool on the cell.

javascriptCopy code

`// Example usage for cell interaction elementsCell.forEach((element) => {   element.addEventListener("click", function () {     handleCellClick(element);   }); });`

Note: This is a simplified example, and you can customize the logic, questions, and answers according to your game's requirements. Have fun building your Minecraft 2D game!
